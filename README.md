Thank you for taking interest in testing out my project.

Introduction

Welcome to the repository of GenericTask. The repository has my project sources for a basic task
management system. It is written in Python 3 with wxPython 4.1.0.

Installing

1. Install Python 3 in your operating system.
2. Install wxPython in your operating system.
3. Open a terminal or command line.
4. Install git if you are familiar with it. If not, proceed to next step.
5. Download a copy of this directory using either git or by downloading the zip file. To download
using git in the terminal or command line

git clone https://github.com/gamehelphere/generictask.git

To download the zip file, click the green Code button, and click Download ZIP. Make sure your 
operating system has an extraction program that can open ZIP files. Extract the ZIP file. It will
make a 'generictask' directory that has the project sources. Get in that directory using the proper
command like 'cd generictask'

6. Run the project sources using

python3 generictask.py

7. Exit the program by clicking 'Exit' or the close 'x' button in the top of the window.


Troubleshooting

If generictask does not work, it is most likely you are missing Python 3 or wxPython. Check your
directory if you are inside 'generictask' because you might be running the code out of that directory.
